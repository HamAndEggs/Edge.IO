# Edge.IO
GPU accellerated and high preformance UI rendering for embedded single board computers. Makes use of the Edge UI library and a script based UI building to allow OTA of the UI. The script can be loaded from a local drive or a webserver. 

The intention is that this project is the base for your UI, you fork it and add any missing features. As time goes more and more features will be added making more and more less likley would would need to make modifications.
